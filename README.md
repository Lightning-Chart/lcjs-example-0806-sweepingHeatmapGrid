# JavaScript Sweeping Heatmap Chart

![JavaScript Sweeping Heatmap Chart](sweepingHeatmapGrid-darkGold.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

This example shows how to create a _sweeping update effect_ in 2D Heatmap Chart with LightningChart JS.

This is done by using `HeatmapGridSeries` (static size 2D heatmap) and writing on top of previous heatmap values in sweeping motion.

This behavior is preferred by some users, mostly since the chart gives real-time visualization but at the same time is _immobile_.

For alternate approach with _scrolling data appending_, see our [scrolling heatmap example](https://lightningchart.com/lightningchart-js-interactive-examples/examples/lcjs-example-0803-scrollingHeatmap.html).

Scrolling approach is generally encouraged since it interacts much nicer with _scrolling Axis ticks_, which as can be seen from the scrolling heatmap example - looks really nice with _live data_!

Performance-wise there is not much difference between the two - both operations are optimized to the maximum!
